ANSWERE TO

    _ First whereas the Generall doth say,

    _ Secondly, The general doth write vnto

dyed for verie griefe that hee had
lost so many Barkes and men.

    _ Thirdly, The generall doth say of his
owne credite, and not by intelligence
from any Indian or other,
that on the eleauenth of March
last hee met the English fleete at
the Isle of Pinas, being fourteene
good Shippes, who although they
had the winde of him, yet hee set
vppon them three times with all
their Shippes, but the English
fleete fled, and refused to fight shooting
now and then a shot, but especially
the Admirall.

    _ Fourthly, The generall saith, that the
English fleete fled awaye, and left
their Oares for haste behind them
in the Sea.

    _ Fiftly, The generall doth say in his
Printed letter, that notwithstanding
all the diligence he could vse,
hee coulde not cause the English
fleete to staie nor come neere them,
nor discharge one Hargebush or
peece of Artillerie, but fled away
as fast as they could.

    _ Sixtly, The generall saith in his letter,
that notwithstanding their flying
away so fast, the English left
them one good Shippe well manned,
who told him that the Drake
dyed in Nombre de Dios, in
which Shippe were one hundred
and fourtie men, and fifteene noble
Captaines of the best sorte.
